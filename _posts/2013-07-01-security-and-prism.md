The continuous revelations about PRISM and the extent to which it allows the United States' government to monitor people is frankly terrifying. While theere are claims that US citizens are protected form the prying eyes of PRISM under the fourth amendment, I have my doubts. There is a section that allows ANY communications to be kept if they are believed to contain encrypted content or to contain a hidden meaning.

Subtext is a hidden meaning. Private jokes have a hidden meaning. Flirting has a hidden meaning.

Given that almost all of human comunication is non-verbal, textual or verbal communication is almost required to have a hidden meaning if you want to get any meaning across!


Of course, non US citizens explicitly have no such 'protections' from PRISM. Anything that moves over an internet connection that is accesible to the NSA is fair game according to the government of the United States!

What can we do about this? Encrypt everything! No, really, what's stopping you from encrypting your communications with others? Is it simply because you don't care if the US government is listening in on all of your conversations or is it that you believe that they would never keep your conversations?

In the first case, there's nothing for you to do because you must trust that the government would never inappropriately use all of that data that they're gathering!

If it's the later; however, you should stop kidding yourself. Of course your information is being kept and analyzed! The only reasonable thing for us to do is to take an active step towards securing all of our digital communication to make the workload increasingly impossible to deter casual monitoring of our activities!
