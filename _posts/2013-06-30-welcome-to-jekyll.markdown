This is probably the first time you've heard from me unless you've read another article here first; however, this is my first time communicating in your direction. I plan to write on here to expound on my views about what is happening in the world and how I hope that people will respond to it!

While I'm sure that many people do not care about my thoughts(why should they), I plan to share them anyways and hope that some of it resonates with you, my reader. I don't know what all I'm going to write about but I do intend to make it relevant and hopefully useful. I may talk about things like privacy, encryption, and laws. I might sometimes ramble about politics(although I will try not to lean too far either way, my ramblings are more likely to be about politicians).

My posts may lean towards the highly technical at times but I will attempt to keep them approachable for everybody; arcane knowledge does no good if it cannot be shared with the general public.  Most of all, I hope that any readers of this blog will find something that they can take away.
